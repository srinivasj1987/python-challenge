# Python-challenge
This project analyzed financial record of sample company and vote-counting of using Python.

## PyBank

In this challenge, my task is to create a Python script for analyzing the financial records of PyBank. I was given a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. 

I created a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset

* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

* The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

This is the result after running the script.
```

## PyPoll
Vote-Counting

In this challenge, my task is to help a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. 

I was given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. My task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

* The total number of votes cast

* A complete list of candidates who received votes

* The percentage of votes each candidate won

* The total number of votes each candidate won

* The winner of the election based on popular vote.

This is the result after running a script.
